- `mkdir folder_name` - Make Directory called folder_name
- `touch file_name.txt` - Make File called file_name.txt

Github is a tool used to collaborate on software projects. Here are the git commands we'll be using.
- `git clone url` - Clones the repository at the URL into a local folder
- `git add .` - Adds all the changes before commiting
- `git commit -m "message"` - Commit changes to your local branch
- `git push` - Push local branch to remote / online branch
- `git pull` - Pulls changes on remote branch to local branch
- `git merge branch_name` - Merge's branch_name into your local branch
- `git status` - Displays the status of your current local branch.

## üìù Assignment 0
1. Clone this Github Repo `class-0`
2. Create your branch. Be sure to name it properly!
3. Make the specific changes to which you were assigned.
4. If other people have made changes to the project, ensure their changes are merged into yours.
5. Create a pull request (PR). Leave a note for me highlighting the changes you've made.

Once I review and approve your PR and you merge it in, you're done!

If you ask me a question before you ask Google a question, I will give you more homework next week.
