- `git commit -m "message"` - Commit changes to your local branch
- `git push` - Push local branch to remote / online branch
- `git pull` - Pulls changes on remote branch to local branch
- `git merge branch_name` - Merges local branch_name into your current branch
- `git status` - Displays the status of your current local branch.

Branch Related Commands

## üìù Assignment 0
1. Clone this Github Repo `class-0`
2. Create your branch. Be sure to name it properly!
3. Make the specific changes to which you were assigned.
4. Once finished, ensure other changes to the master branch are merged into your local branch.
5. Create a pull request (PR) for your local branch. Leave a note for me highlighting the changes you've made.

Once I review and approve your PR and you merge it in, you're done!
